# Welcome!
Boop is a simple programming language that is heavily work in progress but is still fun to try! Boop has simple syntax and is easy to learn.


I started creating Boop after I created Spirit, a bad programming language that contains many bugs. I took my experience from Spirit and made Boop!(Boop is better, by the way)

# Usage
To use Boop, you must use the interpreter, or import into a python3 program.
```python
from boop import core


MyBoopFile = open("examples\hello.bp")
core.load(MyBoopFile)
```
Outputs:
```
Hello, Boop!

[Program Finished]
```
# Thanks!
Thanks for reading! Even if you didn't like it, it still means a lot to me that you took the time to read the entire thing down to here!
If you have found bugs or have suggestions on what to do, put it in Issues.
# Bye!
